## Layout & Responsiveness Notes

My layout approach was based on a clean and organized design, using a grid layout to evenly distribute the cards and consistent spacing to improve visual readability. I followed UI/UX principles, ensuring a clear hierarchy between the image, name, price, and actions.  

For responsiveness, I used flexible units and media queries so the card adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining good usability on both mobile and desktop devices.
